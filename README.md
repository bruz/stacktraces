# stacktraces

A hack to create an API for [StackExchange][stx]'s RESTful API in Clojure.

## Usage

I don't have any usage right now.  It's still a  bunch of hackish scripts
largely modeled after [Rayne](https://github.com/Raynes/)'s [tentacles](https://github.com/Raynes/tentacles) API,
and doesn't deviate largely from the structure of that API.

# Note

I'm using this as an experiment to understand Clojure a bit more and try to make
something useful out of it along the way.  If there are things I'm obviously
doing wrong, I would _love_ to hear about it.  Please contact me:
